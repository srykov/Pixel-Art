# Pixel Art Maker Project
This was a project that I developed as part of my [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The application is a single page web application that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.

This repository is the finished code for _my_  Pixel Art project. Therefore, I will  most likely will not accept pull requests.
