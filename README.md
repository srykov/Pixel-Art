# Pixel Art Maker Project
This was a project that I developed as part of my Udacity [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The project required me to create a single page web application that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas. Udacity provided some starter HTML & CSS code. I wrote the javascript to bring the canvas functionality to life, as well as customizing the HTML and CSS a bit.

## What I Learned
This project gave me an opportunity to test out what I learned in the Javascript Foundations and Intro to jQuery courses.

Specifically I practiced:
* using jQuery's DOM manipulation and traversal methods
* declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as Event Listeners

## Getting Started
You can try the Pixel Maker out here:

Alternatively you can try The Pixel Art Maker out by doing the following:
* Download the source code
* Open index.html in your browser.
* Select grid size & your favorite color. And then start clicking!
