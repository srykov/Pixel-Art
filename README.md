# Pixel Art Maker Project
This was a project that I developed as part of my Udacity [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The project required me to create a single page web application that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas. Udacity provided some starter HTML & CSS code. I wrote the javascript to bring the canvas functionality to life, as well as customizing the HTML and CSS a bit.

## What I Learned
This project gave me an opportunity to test out what I learned in the Javascript Foundations and Intro to jQuery courses.

Specifically I practiced:
* using jQuery's DOM manipulation and traversal methods
* declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as Event Listeners

## Contributing

This repository is the finished code for _my_  Pixel Art project. Therefore, I will  most likely will not accept pull requests.
